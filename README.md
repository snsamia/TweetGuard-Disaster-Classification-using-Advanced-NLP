# TweetGuard: Disaster Classification using Advanced NLP

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

## Overview

**TweetGuard** is an advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) project designed to classify disaster-related tweets. Using a blend of traditional machine learning and cutting-edge transformer models (such as BERT and BART), TweetGuard transforms raw social media data into actionable insights for emergency response, media, government agencies, and NGOs.
